## Project Description

PoliceOnWeb was designed to meet the growing needs of both citizens and law enforcement in a digital environment. The project is based on an in-depth study that identified the expected features and technical constraints of the system.

### Objectives

- **Digitization of police services**: Simplify complaint filing and incident reporting.
- **Effective communication**: Provide a platform for fast and secure exchanges between citizens and police.
- **Transparency and responsiveness**: Enable authorities to act quickly in emergencies while building public trust.

### Main Features

- **For the Administrator**:
  - Manage reports and respond to users.
  - View testimonies.
  - Manage wanted, missing, and unidentified persons.
  - Administer unclaimed property.
  - Update and display FAQs and visitor messages.
  - Visualize statistics on crimes and complaints.

- **For the User**:
  - File and track complaints.
  - Report missing persons.
  - Publish testimonies.
  - Manage personal profile and view interaction history.

- **For the Visitor**:
  - View news and local updates published by the admin.
  - Access frequently asked questions.
  - Interact with the admin via messaging.

### Technologies and Architecture

The project is based on a robust, modular architecture using the following technologies:

- **Back-end**:
  - **Java EE** for business logic and transaction management.
  - **Apache Tomcat** as the application server.
  - **MySQL** for database management.

- **Front-end**:
  - **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for a modern, responsive user interface.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** to separate presentation and business logic.
  - **DAO (Data Access Object)** for data access and code modularity.

The software architecture is divided into several layers, ensuring a clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access. Java packages are organized to manage business objects, data access (DAO), and servlets that bridge the front-end and back-end. The project structure is complemented by a well-organized set of web resources (images, scripts, styles) and dedicated interfaces for administration and users.

### Benefits and Challenges

- **Improved responsiveness**: Allows the police to respond quickly in emergency situations.
- **Accessibility**: Provides a solution accessible to all, including those unable to visit a police station.
- **Security and reliability**: Ensures secure communication and reliable data‚Äîessential for building trust between citizens and authorities.
- **Ease of use**: An intuitive interface for seamless navigation and access to services.
